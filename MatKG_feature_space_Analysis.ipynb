       " 'In this letter we present Hall effect and resistivity data which demonstrate that EuB 6 is a degenerate semiconductor transforming into a metal or semimetal below the ferromagnetic ordering temperature (T c = 13.7 K).Where comparisons are possible, our experimental results on Al flux grown single crystals are in good agreement with polycrystalline data by Ishikawa [8] which have recently been summarized by Kasuya, et al.\\n',\n",
       " '3.In particular, if a one band model is assumed, we may interpret the curve as follows: Between 297 and ~150 K, electrons excited accross an intrinsic semiconductor gap are gradually frozen out.The plateau between ~150 and ~100 K represents the exhaustion range with n = 10-8+(leH/HA Ixe) = 3.5x1019cm -3 due to defects and impurities.Here the calculated mobilities are inordinately high at ~300 cm2/v sec.The subsequent decrease in l eH/HAI as the temperature is lowered further signals the onset of an electronic phase transition.It should also be mentioned that, below 70 K, e H is not linear in applied magnetic field, H a , which might be interpreted as a field dependence of the carrier number.The major result of the Hall measurements, however, is that the EuB 6 is not a simple degenerate semiconductor.If that were the case, no change in R o would be expected at low temperature, whereas a factor 5 decrease is observed between 110 K and 4.2 K.We conclude, therefore, that EuB 6 has a magnetically driven phase transition to a low temperature semimetal or metal with a sizeable change in carrier number.\\n',\n",
