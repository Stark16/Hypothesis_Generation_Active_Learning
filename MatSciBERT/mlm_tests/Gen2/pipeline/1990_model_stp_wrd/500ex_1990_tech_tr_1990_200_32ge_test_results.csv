Entropy balance in zero field shows that C/T in the normal phase must increase on coolmg [2,6]: so it is quite natural to recover a rising of ('IT at constant field as the induced vortices gradually restore the contribution of the excitations of the normal phase to C. The distorsion of the exponential relaxation of T appears on a time scale of a tenth of seconds, much shorter than the 500 seconds which can be extrapolated from NMR data [5] at tt = 6 T. This drastic change indicates a modification in the vortices since their excitations dominate the nuclear relaxation rate [51.	entropy balance in zero field shows that c/t in the normal phase must increase on coolmg [2,6]: so it is quite natural to recover a rising of ('it at constant field as the induced vortices gradually restore the contribution of the excitations of the normal phase to c. the distorsion of the exponential relaxation of t appears on a time scale of a tenth of seconds, much shorter than the 500 seconds which can be extrapolated from nmr data [5] at tt = 6 t. this drastic change indicates a modification in the vortices since their excitations dominate the nuclear relaxation rate [51.	rate	rate	True	True	I-PRO	base_bert_tech

Entropy balance in zero field shows that C/T in the normal phase must increase on coolmg [2,6]: so it is quite natural to recover a rising of ('IT at constant field as the induced vortices gradually restore the contribution of the excitations of the normal phase to C. The distorsion of the exponential relaxation of T appears on a time scale of a tenth of seconds, much shorter than the 500 seconds which can be extrapolated from NMR data [5] at tt = 6 T.
