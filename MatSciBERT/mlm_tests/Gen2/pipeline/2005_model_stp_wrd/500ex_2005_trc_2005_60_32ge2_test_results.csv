The truly amazing thing to note about Si MOSFETs exhibiting a 2D M-I-T is that n c is so low, ~ 10 11 cm -2 , and hence T F <~ 7 K that the 'metallic' system just above the M-I-T shows a classical to quantum transport crossover in the narrow temperature range of T ~ 0.1 - 10 K. This transport crossover is reflected in the observed 1,4 strong nonmonotonicity of ρ(T ) on the metallic side of the transition (n s > n c ), where ρ(T ) invariably rises with temperature for higher temperatures (as in ρ c ) before exhibiting the metallic behavior of a positive temperature coefficient (as in ρ q ) at lower temperatures where ρ(T ) decreases with lowering temperatures.	the truly amazing thing to note about si mosfets exhibiting a 2d m-i-t is that n c is so low, ~ 10 k cm -2 , and hence t f <~ 7 k that the 'metallic' system just above the m-i-t shows a classical to quantum transport crossover in the narrow temperature range of t ~ 0.1 - 10 k. this transport crossover is reflected in the observed 1,4 strong nonmonotonicity of ρ(t ) on the metallic side of the transition (n s > n c ), where ρ(t ) invariably rises with temperature for higher temperatures (as in ρ c ) before exhibiting the metallic behavior of a positive temperature coefficient (as in ρ q ) at lower temperatures where ρ(t ) decreases with lowering temperatures.	11	k	False	False	O	mlm_bert_non_tech
