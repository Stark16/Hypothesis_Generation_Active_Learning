The conclusion reached from the present study is that the electrochemical formation of hydrogen on palladium electrodes previously treated as cathodes in the same melt occurs similarly to the reaction on active platinum electrodes, particularly at low overvoltage.A reproducible palladium-hydrogen electrode in moltenbisulphate is also accomplished, as a consequence of the type of kinetics obeyed by the process.The a-palladium-hydrogen electrode formed in this case actually has a composition corresponding to that of the a-phase region, different from the a-palladium electrode at room temperature, which has a composition in the two-phase region.Here the potential is essentially independent of the H/Pd ratio.As already established by means of potential/composition data, at room temperature the electrode potential is dependent upon the composition of the electrode in the pure a-phase.N*1Dm41 This conclusion applies also to the palladium-hydrogen electrode in the molten bisulphates.	the conclusion reached from the present study is that the electrochemical formation of hydrogen on palladium electrodes previously treated as cathodes in the same melt occurs similarly to the reaction on active platinum electrodes, particularly at the overvoltage.a reproducible palladium-hydrogen electrode in moltenbisulphate is also accomplished, as a consequence of the type of kinetics obeyed by the process.the a-palladium-hydrogen electrode formed in this case actually has a composition corresponding to that of the a-phase region, different from the a-palladium electrode at room temperature, which has a composition in the two-phase region.here the potential is essentially independent of the h/pd ratio.as already established by means of potential/composition data, at room temperature the electrode potential is dependent upon the composition of the electrode in the pure a-phase.n*1dm41 this conclusion applies also to the palladium-hydrogen electrode in the molten bisulphates.	low	the	False	False	O	base_bert_non_tech
