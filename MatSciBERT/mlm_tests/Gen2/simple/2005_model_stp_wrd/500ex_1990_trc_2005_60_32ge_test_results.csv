That is, the effective bandwidth is not very much larger than k s times the superconducting transition temperature T e, which in turn is of the order of the gap energy.Alternatively we can phrase this by noting that the spin-orbit scattering length lo, which is given by the relation I0 = XVF*, where VF* is the renormalized Fermi velocity of the heavy quasi-particles, must be anomalously small because of the greatly reduced value of VF*.The value of 1o, consistent with the above derived upper limit, turns out to be of the order of 20 /~ (see below); this rules out the possibility of spin-orbit scattering at the boundaries of the sample.The alternative explanation is scattering off the Gd impurities.We shall now argue that the scattering cross section of the Gd impurities may indeed be expected to be very large in heavy fermion materials like UBel 3.	that is, the effective bandwidth is not very much larger than k s times the superconducting transition temperature t e, which in turn is of the order of the gap energy.alternatively we can phrase this by noting that the spin-orbit scattering length lo, which is given by the formula i0 = xvf*, where vf* is the renormalized fermi velocity of the heavy quasi-particles, must be anomalously small because of the greatly reduced value of vf*.the value of 1o, consistent with the above derived upper limit, turns out to be of the order of 20 /~ (see below); this rules out the possibility of spin-orbit scattering at the boundaries of the sample.the alternative explanation is scattering off the gd impurities.we shall now argue that the scattering cross section of the gd impurities may indeed be expected to be very large in heavy fermion materials like ubel 3.	relation	formula	False	False	O	base_bert_non_tech
