In the former case, a very strong spin-orbit scattering due to the Gd impurities has to be assumed in order to explain the results.One must conclude that in this case the probe unfortunately destroys the effect one tries to measure.In this light it is interesting to compare the present results with recently presented muon-spin resonance (IxSR) dataJ 1 In that work, it is found that the muon Knight-shift does decrease dramatically below T c in UBe13 but not in U0.97Th.03Be13.An important difference with the present experiment, is the fact that the muons are located interstitially and that there are no impurities substituted on U-sites which can serve as scattering centers.This in turn data appears to support the interpretation in terms of strong spin-orbit scattering given in this paper, and suggests even parity superconductivity.In view of this conclusion, it would be very interesting if the gSR experiments were repeated in a Gd-doped sample.Be-NMR measurements in pure UBe13 are expected to yield results comparable to those using IxSR.Such measurements have been reported in the normal state 5 of monocrystalline UBel 3.	in the former case, a very strong spin-orbspin scattering due to the gd impurities has to be assumed in order to explain the results.one must conclude that in this case the probe unfortunately destroys the effect one tries to measure.in this light it is interesting to compare the present results with recently presented muon-spin resonance (ixsr) dataj 1 in that work, it is found that the muon knight-shift does decrease dramatically below t c in ube13 but not in u0.97th.03be13.an important difference with the present experiment, is the fact that the muons are located interstitially and that there are no impurities substituted on u-sites which can serve as scattering centers.this in turn data appears to support the interpretation in terms of strong spin-orbit scattering given in this paper, and suggests even parity superconductivity.in view of this conclusion, it would be very interesting if the gsr experiments were repeated in a gd-doped sample.be-nmr measurements in pure ube13 are expected to yield results comparable to those using ixsr.such measurements have been reported in the normal state 5 of monocrystalline ubel 3.	it	spin	False	False	O	base_bert_non_tech

There are two main hypotheses to explain the ~dinary values for g and AB in UBe13 in the normal state.As pointed out by Varma, a one can expect the matrix elements involved to be smaller by a factor equal to the enhancement of the density of states, thereby cancelling the effect of the explicit factors N(eF).This interpretation relies strongly on the many-body nature of the heavy-fermion state.On the other hand, even in the probably less realistic static hybridization picture, the effect of the large density of states may be cancelled out, as the Gd impurities couple to the U 5f electrons indirectly through the small hybridization matrix element.	there are two main hypotheses to explain the ~dinary values for g and ab in ube13 in the normal state.as pointed out by varma, a one can expect the matrix elements involved to be smaller by a factor equal to the enhancement of the density of states, thereby cancelling the effect of the explicit factors n(ef).this interpretation relies strongly on the many-body nature of the heavy-fermion state.on the other hand, even in the probably less realistic static hybridization picture, the effect of the large density of states may be cancelled out, as the gd impurities couple to the u 5f electrons indirectly through the small hybridization matrix element.	hand	hand	True	False	O	mlm_bert_non_tech
