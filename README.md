# ðŸŒŒ Feature Space: Hierarchical Embeddings for Scientific Discovery  

## ðŸ“– Overview  
The **Feature Space** branch explores a **theoretical approach** to embedding scientific knowledge in a structured, hierarchical manner. Instead of treating embeddings as isolated vector representations, this research aims to create a **context-aware feature space** where knowledge is stored and retrieved based on **hierarchical relationships** between concepts.  

This approach is inspired by how humans organize and understand informationâ€”through **definitions, contexts, and hierarchical structures** rather than flat, disconnected embeddings.  For a better understand of the approach check out this link.

## ðŸŒ³ The Core Idea: Hierarchical Context Trees  
At its heart, this research proposes a **context tree** model for structuring knowledge. Hereâ€™s the high-level thought process:  

ðŸ”¹ **Hierarchical Definitions** â€“ Concepts aren't isolated; they exist in layers of meaning. For example, "semiconductors" belong to "electronic materials," which belong to "materials science."  

ðŸ”¹ **Contextual Embeddings** â€“ Instead of static word embeddings, each embedding is influenced by its **parent** and **child** concepts in a **tree-like structure**. This allows for **adaptive embeddings** based on context.  

ðŸ”¹ **Generative Model for Queries** â€“ The goal is to generate **scientific statements** (hypotheses) dynamically, which can then be tested against **MatSciBERT**. These queries are iteratively refined to improve hypothesis prediction.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Work in Progress  
This research is still **theoretical** at this stage, with ongoing development in:  

- ðŸŒŸ **Defining hierarchical embedding structures**  
- ðŸ§© **Exploring methods for structuring knowledge as a context tree**  
- ðŸ”„ **Iterating on query formulation for hypothesis generation**  

## ðŸ”¬ Connection to the Larger Research  
This branch serves as the **foundation for hypothesis prediction**, enabling structured knowledge retrieval and improving the **scientific reasoning capabilities** of machine learning models. Future iterations will refine this hierarchical feature space and integrate it more deeply with **MatSciBERT**.  

ðŸš§ **Still evolving!** As we experiment with different models and embedding strategies, this branch will continue to evolve to refine its theoretical underpinnings.
